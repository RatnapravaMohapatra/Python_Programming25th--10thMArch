## Overview(3rd March)
This document provides an overview of various data structures available in Python, their characteristics, and use cases. Understanding these data structures is crucial for efficient programming and algorithm design.

## Key Data Structures
### 1. Lists
*Definition*: Ordered, mutable collections of items.
*Characteristics*:Can contain mixed data types.Supports indexing and slicing.
*Use Cases*: Storing sequences of items, dynamic arrays.
### 2. Tuples
*Definition*: Ordered, immutable collections of items.
*Characteristics*:Can contain mixed data types.Faster than lists due to immutability.
*Use Cases*: Fixed collections of items, returning multiple values from functions.
### 3. Sets
*Definition*: Unordered collections of unique items.
*Characteristics*:No duplicate elements.Supports mathematical set operations (union, intersection).
*Use Cases*: Membership testing, removing duplicates from a list.
### 4. Dictionaries
*Definition*: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
*Characteristics*:Keys must be unique and immutable.Fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.
*Use Cases*: Storing data with a unique identifier, implementing associative arrays.
### Conclusion
*Understanding these fundamental data structures is essential for effective programming in Python. Each structure has its own strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different scenarios*.
